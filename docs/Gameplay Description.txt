[Input device is a PS3/Xbox/console controller]
[Power-ups appear in larger number each time they are collected (+1)]

Player controls a ship, left stick for movement direction, right stick for
aiming and firing is done with the left trigger. The player collects power-ups
by running into them. Power-ups allow the ship to attack, add to score,
increase score multiplier and cause the ship and enemies to speed up. Attacking
drains the multiplier.

[Enemies appear in larger numbers each time a power-up is collected (+1)]
[Enemies charge at the player as soon as they spawn]

When an enemy runs into the ship the score multiplier is dropped back to 1. If
the ship is hit while the multiplier is equal to 1 it is game over.
